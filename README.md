# Capstone
Capstone Project

In addition to general documentation,

Here I will provide weekly status updates on my project

## Project Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to utilize a variety of data science, and software engineering techniques to build a website that brings some benefit to a group of people (to be decided after project idea submission). In this project I would like to use: 
- Artificial Intelligence: This could be designing a machine learning model, using NLP, or building a recommendation algorithm
- Design a website a user can interact with: Allow a user to input something into a website, and receive something in return

## Week 1: Jan/21 - Jan/27
- Introduction: Discuss general details and guidlines of project
- Deliverable: Set up status tracker & Project Ideas

### Failures:
 
 No failures yet.

### Successes:

Enjoyed brainstorming project ideas, and am excited to get started.

### Difficulties: 

Had a hard time designing a project that will incorperate everything I want to accomplish.

### Goals for Next Week

My main goal for next week is to choose a project idea, and work on the design doc. For the design doc I would like to:
- Create a general outline of what I would like to include in the project, and by which dates I will need to complete everything

Due: Feb/4
- Create the requirement specification slides: include high level requirements, target audience & users, and an engineering diagram of inputs and outputs of project 


Project Ideas

Idea 1: 

Build a website that compares a job description to a resume, and provides a score as to how well matched the resume is to the job description:
- Utilize NLP to identify most important words in the job description, and check if the resume has these
- Build an algorithm to identify how well matched the resume is to the job description
- Additional Feature: Use webscraping or find an API to ingest job description data, and extract most frequently used skills associated with job titles. Allow the user to filter for job titles and view top skills associated with each title

Idea 2:

Product Price Tracker: Vehicles
- Ingest data for current cars available for purchase, and recommend the best vehicle to purchase. Build the recommender algorithim using price, miles, months on lot etc. Identify specific factors that would bring the value of the vehicle down, and provide these to the user to help negotiate a lower price. 

Idea 3: 

Predict which Tech Skills will be most relevant in the future
- Utilize historical job description data for tech jobs, and predict which skills & technologies will become more important in the next five year

## Week 2: Jan/28 - Feb/3
- Deliverable: None 

### Failures:
Continued research on idea one. My main goal is to get idea one working, but I need to find some data sources that work to validate the model. I have found one article that references two different data sets, but I am having issues accessing them. I will spend the next day or so doing some addional research, and if I cannot find a data source to use, I will pivot to a new idea. 

### Successes: 

Finding the one article that references sources.

### Difficulties: 

Coming up with alternative ideas that would involve easier data sources.

## Week 3: Feb/4 - Feb/10
- Deliverable: Create the requirement specification slides: include high level requirements, target audience & users, and an engineering diagram of inputs and outputs of project 

### Successes: 
Successfully chose a topic to work on! I decided to do my project on the MBTA Communities Law, and explore the effects of this law on certian topics such as traffic, infrustructure, schools, and property value. 

### Failures:
No failures this week

### Difficulties: 
MassDot data I found is very granular, but unfortunately does not include many data points. There are many locations that provide data, but from the 2 I have looked at so far, there were only 2 days worth of data for the entire year for 1 or 2 years. I still think that this data is usable because of the extensive amounts of traffic locations, but it will involve work to make the data usable. 

For next week, I plan to finalize the data sources I would like to use for this project, and begin to ingest & store the data or create a plan how I would like to ingest the data. Some data is easy to access in the form of a csv file. Some data, like the MassDot data does not seem to have export capabilities. I might try and reach out to the website to see if they have an api. Alternitively it would be a rather manual process to retreive the data, but not impossible. 

### Data Sources Identified So Far:
- Law Info: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mbta-communities-law-qa#:~:text=The%20MBTA%20Communities%20Act%20requires,%2C%20ferry%20terminal%20or%20subway
- MassDot: Provides total number of cars that pass through a specific location every 15 minutes: https://www.mass.gov/traffic-volume-and-classification-in-massachusetts
- Census Data: avialable through mapc.org. Provides population data every 10 years: https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/262
- MAPC Education related Data: Includes Enrollment and Dropout data by town


## Week 4: Feb/11 - Feb/17
- Deliverable: None 

## Week 5: Feb/18 - Feb/24
- Deliverable: Competency Demo - 5-minute demonstration of something the you have used and learned towards the project 

## Week 6: Feb/25 - Mar/3
- Deliverable: None 

## Week 7: Mar/4 - Mar/10
- Deliverable: Design Document - Elaborate on the “hows” to build the project.  This document should be long and fairly low-level.

## Week 8: Mar/11 - Mar/17
- Deliverable: None 

## Week 9: Mar/18 - Mar/24
Half way through the semester
- Deliverable: Proof of Concept Demo - Provide a 5-minute demo to show that you can do the critical feature necessary to complete capstone project. Example: if a recommendation engine is the critical component on project, PoC shall be a simple recommendation engine.
