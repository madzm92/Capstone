Capstone Project

In addition to general documentation,

Here I will provide weekly status updates on my project

## Week 1: Jan/21 - Jan/28

- Deliverable: Set up status tracker & Project Ideas

### Failures:
 
 No failures yet.

### Successes:

Enjoyed brainstorming project ideas, and am excited to get started.

### Difficulties: 

Had a hard time designing a project that will incorperate everything I want to accomplish.

### Goals for Next Week

My main goal for next week is to choose a project idea, and work on the design doc. For the design doc I would like to:
- Create a general outline of what I would like to include in the project, and by which dates I will need to complete everything

Due: Feb/4
- Create the requirement specification slides: include high level requirements, target audience & users, and an engineering diagram of inputs and outputs of project 


Project Ideas

Idea 1: 

Build a website that compares a job description to a resume, and provides a score as to how well matched the resume is to the job description:
- Utilize NLP to identify most important words in the job description, and check if the resume has these
- Build an algorithm to identify how well matched the resume is to the job description
- Additional Feature: Use webscraping or find an API to ingest job description data, and extract most frequently used skills associated with job titles. Allow the user to filter for job titles and view top skills associated with each title

Idea 2:

Product Price Tracker: Vehicles
- Ingest data for current cars available for purchase, and recommend the best vehicle to purchase. Build the recommender algorithim using price, miles, months on lot etc. Identify specific factors that would bring the value of the vehicle down, and provide these to the user to help negotiate a lower price. 

Idea 3: 

Predict which Tech Skills will be most relevant in the future
- Utilize historical job description data for tech jobs, and predict which skills & technologies will become more important in the next five year
